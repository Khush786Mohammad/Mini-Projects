Hey Linkedin family,

Recently I created a dummy portfolio website of mine to sharpen my CSS skills.

It was a great learning during the whole project, and understand some very interesting concept in CSS.



Here is my GitHub repo link: https://github.com/Khush786Mohammad/Portfolio01.git



Atlast I would to like to give thanks to codehelp for this amazin learning. ðŸ˜€
